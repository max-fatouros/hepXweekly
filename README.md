```
git clone https://github.com/ShreyasBakare/hepXweekly.git
pip install feedparser
```
Then either you can add 
```
alias hepxweekly="python3 ~/work/hepXweekly/hep_ex_weekly.py"
```
(with correct path)
to your .bashrc/.zshrc and everytime you run `hepxweekly` you will get the latest papers from arxiv that you can further filter using keywords/ read title, author, abstract or enter the sr. no. to directly open the pdf of that paper in your browser.
